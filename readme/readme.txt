This is command plugin for CudaText. 
It performs search with given words on DevDocs.io site.

Plugin has two commands: "Search by input", "Search by text". Command "Search by text" does search for current word at editor caret, or for current selected text if selection exists.

Examples:

    If you enter "js date", then search will be done for JavaScript "date" word;
    If you enter "html frame", then search will be done for HTML "frame" word;
    If you enter "php print", then search will be done for PHP "print" word (note: first enable PHP language on DevDocs site);
    If you enter one word, search for all languages (enabled on DevDocs site) will be done.
